For the school summary we see all the data displayed grouped by schools. It shows a picture of how each school performed in respect to each other. 
When looking at the Highest Performing Schools we can see that all of them are charter schools. It shows that average reading score was higher than every math score, also showcasing that more students passed reading over math.
Just like with Highest Performing, the Bottom Performing schools were all District schools, with the avg math score/passing rate both lower than reading.
Math scores by grade was interesting to me because it shows all the grades and their respective math scores, grouped by school. It shows that all the scores generally stayed relatively close throughout the years. While they did change, it was always within a point or two.
For reading score by grade, we can see that it still follows the same trend as math, scores are slightly higher, but also following a similar path where numeric values stay in the same area.
Scores by School Spending, this shows each of the schools put into a bin based upon spending. To show you how many are in the same designated range of spending.
Scores by School Size show similarly to the School Spending bins but allows you to compare based on school size by student volume.
Scores by School Type compares Charter vs District. This shows a drastic difference of scores and passing percentages.
What I noticed throughout this project was that the more money you spend per student, doesnâ€™t necessarily mean the students perform better. 
I also enjoyed seeing that the larger the school, the worse the students performed. Consequently, the smaller, the higher the avg score and passing rates.
